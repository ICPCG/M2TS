FUNCOM Processed Dataset

This dataset includes 4 files. Due to the data being multi-line we opted for json format for this dataset.

NOTE: When reading .json file, the key defaults to a string value

comments.json - dictionary of {funtion_id: comment}
functions.json - dictionary of {function_id: source code}
fid_pid.json - dictionary of {function_id: project_id}
fid_pid - same as above but txt format, tab delimited list of function_id -> project_id mapping
load.py - a few helper functions for loading the data from the json files. Returns the data as python dicts
